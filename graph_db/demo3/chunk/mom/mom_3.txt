1.1.2. 3D Printing as a Solution. 3D printing may help
alleviate the aforementioned challenges, although it
does require OEMs to provide design files. In this
regard, the manufacturing industry should learn from
the experiences of the copyright industry. Rather than
mimicking its futile attempts to curb digital distribution,
OEMs should consider embracing 3D printing by
providing buyers the convenience to print parts for
their own use (Desai and Magliocca 2014). This
becomes feasible with the emergence of 3D printing
platform services, for example, Dassault Syst`emes,
SAP, Siemens (SCM World 2018), Digital Parts Transfer
(Digital Parts Transfer 2020), and Fieldmade Digital
Inventory (Fieldmade 2020). This trend is also supported
by a survey of 38 German industrial companies
by Geissbauer et al. (2017), who find that 85% of spare
parts suppliers believe to incorporate 3D printing into
their business in five years. Indeed, there are already
companies printing spare parts, such as Deutsche Bahn
(Zasiadko 2019), Wilhelmsen (Supercharge3d 2019),
and military organizations (Wibu-Systems 2019).
Such transitions require the development of a supporting
infrastructure for uniform 3D CAD model
database management, software development, printing
service provider (PSP) audits, guaranteed repeatability
of prints, and so on (Mellor et al. 2014, Chekurov
et al. 2018). To prevent IP infringement and sort out
liability issues, transparency of network transactions
can be guaranteed through blockchain ledgers (Sertoglu
2021a). Another solution may be to trust PSPs and
other third parties, such as UPS, SAP, and Siemens, with
the design files. Companies such as Wibu-Systems
(Wibu-Systems 2019) offer technical solutions that can
also help prevent IP infringement.
