:  This paper discusses  the challenges in Maintenance, R epair , and O peration s (MRO)  parts 
inventory management and how Industry 4.0 technologies can be leveraged to address them . Additive 
manufacturing, I nternet of Things (IoT),  big data analytics, machine learning , and new smart mobility 
logist ics models  are emerging technologies that enable efficient  inventory solutions for different types of 
MRO parts . There is no single universal strategy  that work s for all MRO parts due to wide variety of part 
attributes including usage pattern s, lead -time, and cost . In this paper , we propose the clustering of MRO 
parts into different groups  and discuss the potential strategy to improve inventory management efficiency 
by leveraging emerging technologies  for each MRO part group . 
Keywords:  Inventory Control, Maintenance Repair & Operations Inventory, Clustering, Additive 
Manufacturing, Internet of T hings , Predictive Modeling
