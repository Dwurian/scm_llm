5. CONCLUSIONS
The paper focuses on the challenges of MRO parts inventory
management and growing interest in Industry 4.0 technologies
to improve its efficiency. The emerging area of prognostics
leveraging Big Data Analytics, ML and IoT can improve the
forecast of maintenance cycles and spare parts demand.
Additive manufacturing can help to stabilize and reduce leadtime
to procure low usage items. Logistics 4.0 and New Smart
Mobility models provide an efficient transportation network to
support centralization of MRO parts that benefit from demand
variability pooling and consolidation of inventory
management and procurement activities.
In many industrial settings today, all MRO parts are treated
using the same inventory management approach. Using real
world data from the automotive industry we have
demonstrated differences in MRO parts usage patterns, lead
times, and cost and impacts of these parameters on the
efficiency of inventory management. These different attributes
call for the different approaches to improve inventory
efficiency.
We proposed a classification of the MRO parts and associated
strategies to address inventory management solutions from the
perspective of Industry 4.0 technologies. We also proposed a
clustering technique that automatically classifies all the MRO
parts into appropriate groups to focus the consideration of the
appropriate technology innovation.
