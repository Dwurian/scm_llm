One hierarchical view of operations and supply chain strategy is that a natural tension exists between the competitive priorities of cost, ﬂ exibility, speed, and Olsen and Tomlin: Industry 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges 120 Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 2020, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 113 – 122, © 2019 INFORMS Downloaded from informs.org by [128.6.45.217] on 22 May 2025, at 08:12 .

Overall business strategy (e.g., which customers to target and what do they value) helps the operations function make this choice. The ranking among priorities then drives both the design of the tangible architecture of operations (i.e., the degree of vertical integration; the capacity and type of produc- tion, transportation, and MRO assets; inventories; and the geographic distribution of these various elements) and the design of the intangible processes and proce- dures that orchestrate the ﬂ ow of goods and information through this operations and supply chain architecture. As we have already discussed, the technologies underpinning Industry 4.0 can either in isolation or in combination improve one or more of the four pri- orities. More intriguingly, Industry 4.0 may alleviate some of the tension between the priorities and thereby, enable new customer value propositions. Crucially, Industry 4.0 creates new design possibilities for the operations architecture and its associated processes. Certain technologies, the IoT for example, will directly impact the processes for managing the operations and supply chain architecture and thereby, indirectly in ﬂ u- ence architectural choices. Others may directly in ﬂ u- ence the architecture but the processes only indirectly. Figure 1 categorizes technologies by their potential for direct impact on architecture and processes. How- ever, as re ﬂ ected in the ﬁ gure, the key to Industry 4.0 is that it is not an individual technology. Instead, it is a synthesis of these related technologies. We can, there- fore, anticipate that Industry 4.0 will have a profound impact on both the architecture and process dimensions of operations strategy. AM and cheap/con ﬁ gurable robotics reduce the minimum ef ﬁ cient scale required for economic pro- duction and promote ﬂ exibility and speed of production launch. Cobots, AI, wearable devices, and AR can ele- vate (or eliminate) the role of human assets. The IoT, blockchain, and digitization enable remote and real- time monitoring, diagnosis, control, and optimiza- tion within factories and across geographically dis- persed assets. A globally distributed and agile network of production assets that can dynamically and rapidly adjust and reallocate activities becomes possible. It is promises such as these that make many believe that the marriage of the physical and digital worlds that is Industry 4.0 will have a revolutionary impact on operations and supply chain management. The OM community should engage with this vision to both understand the implications and limitations of Industry 4.0 and to help develop the concepts and techniques that will further drive its potential and adoption. We hope that this article will prove to be useful as OM researchers look for opportunities and challenges in this space. Endnote 1 For ease of exposition, we will use the term sensor to describe both the sensor and any associated controller that drives action based on the sensor reading.
