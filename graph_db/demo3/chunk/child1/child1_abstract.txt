. Industry 4.0 connotes a new industrial revolution centered around cyber-physical
systems. It posits that the real-time connection of physical and digital systems, along with
new enabling technologies, will change the way that work is done and therefore, how work
should be managed. It has the potential to break, or at least change, the traditional operations
trade-offs among the competitive priorities of cost, ﬂexibility, speed, and quality. This article
describes the technologies inherent in Industry 4.0 and the opportunities and challenges
for research in this area. The focus is on goods- producing industries, which includes both
the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Speci ﬁc technologies discussed include
additive manufacturing, the internet of things, blockchain, advanced robotics, and ar-
tiﬁcial intelligence.
