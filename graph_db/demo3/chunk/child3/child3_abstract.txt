As mass production has migrated to developing countri es, European and US companies are forced to rapidly
switch towards low volume production of more innovati ve, customised and sustainable products with high
added value. To compete in this turbulent environment, manufacturers have sought new fabrication
techniques to provide the necessary tools to support the need for increased ﬂexibility and enable economic
low volume production. One such emerging technique is Additive Manufacturing (AM). AM is a method of
manufacture which involves the joining of materials, usually layer-upon-layer, to create objects from 3Dmodel data. The bene ﬁts of this methodology include new design freedom, removal of tooling requirements,
and economic low volumes. AM consists of various tec hnologies to process versatile materials, and for many
years its dominant application has been the manufacture of prototypes, or Rapid Prototyping. However, therecent growth in applications for direct part manufacture, or Rapid Manufacturing, has resulted in much
research effort focusing on development of new processes and materials. This study focuses on the
implementation process of AM and is motivated by the lack of socio-technical studies in this area.It addresses the need for existing and potential future AM project managers to have an implementation
framework to guide their efforts in adopting this new and potentially disruptive technology class to produce
high value products and generate new business opportu nities. Based on a review of prior works and through
qualitative case study analysis, we construct and test a normative structural model of implementation factors
related to AM technology, supply chain, organisation, operations and strategy.
